## ðŸš€ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed:

  * **XAMPP:** A local server environment. Download it from [apachefriends.org](https://www.apachefriends.org).
  * **Code Editor:** Any code editor of your choice (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text).
  * **Web Browser:** A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    ```

2.  **Place in `htdocs`**
    Move the entire project folder into the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation (e.g., `C:/xampp/htdocs/`).

3.  **Start XAMPP**
    Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the **Apache** and **MySQL** services.

4.  **Create the Database**

      * Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
      * Click on the **"New"** button in the left sidebar.
      * Enter the database name as `laundry_db` and click **"Create"**.

5.  **Import the SQL File (Optional)**

      * Select the `laundry_db` database you just created.
      * Click on the **"Import"** tab at the top.
      * Choose the `.sql` file provided in the repository and click **"Go"** to create the tables.

6.  **Configure the Database Connection**

      * In the project folder, find the file named `db.example.php`.
      * Make a copy of this file and rename the copy to **`db.php`**.
      * Open the new `db.php` file and fill in your database credentials. For a default XAMPP installation, the values are:
        ```php
        $username = "root";
        $password = ""; // Leave this empty
        ```

### Running the Application

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to:

    ```
    http://localhost/your-project-folder-name/
    ```

    *(Replace `your-project-folder-name` with the actual name of your project folder).*

2.  **Admin Login:**

      * **Username:** `admin`
      * **Password:** `admin123`
